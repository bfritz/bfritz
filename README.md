Welcome!  GitHub is where you'll find a few of my projects and experiments.

My recent interests include:

* Programming in Rust.  [procurve-cli] is a playground for that.
* Exploring Kubernetes and the CNCF landscape.  See [homelab-apps],
  backed by [k0s], [homelab-bootstrap], and [Argo CD] for my recent
  experiments.
* Developer tooling and workflow automation.
